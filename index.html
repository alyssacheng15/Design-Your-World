  <h1 class="bigTitle" id="mission"> BUT WHY? </h1>
  <p class="missionText"> We all go through stress, whether personal, academic, or social pressure. Many teenagers
    do
    not have the time to find their healing spaces, or do not know the opportunities they explore for a healthy form
    of
    escapism. We do not want teens to fall victim to horrible forms of escapism such as drugs or smoking. Even in
    our
    city of Santa Clarita, we have the biggest opioid addiction. Instead, we want them to utilize design softwares
    that
    will let them explore their interest in a positive light and have a healing space for them.

      <p class="sophiaBio">SOPHIA<br>A quick glimpse into my inventiveness is definitely through my nature
        cafe
        – from each
        pixelated lily pad to the counters of my cafe displays my design. I desired to bring that comforting part of
        nature to the buzzing works of the cafe to highlight how unlike ideas can connect depending on how you
        utilize
        them. I was able to see what I was able to connect and express my imagination. I loved learning about the
        program MegaVoxels and how easily accessible the app is for everyone. Starting off with a simple program
        encouraged me to explore different 3D designs and deepen my interest even further with the values of
        escapism.

      <p class="alyssaBio">ALYSSA<br> My world was inspired by the colorful buildings at the Stortorget Square
        in
        Gamla Stan,
        Sweden. Using Autodesk Maya, I modeled and animated a miniature Scandinavian town, along with a modern city
        bus
        and bus stop. The buildings portray my admiration for traditional authentic Swedish architecture, while the
        bus
        represents the contemporary city life that I also enjoy. It’s a combination of old and new, slow and fast,
        loud
        and quiet — it’s a safe space where I find the juxtaposition very inspiring and relaxing.</p>

        I
        3d-modeled the
        exterior of a jazz club with the CAD program, Autodesk Maya. I was heavily inspired by the older design of
        American jazz clubs. I wanted to convey the classic “jazz aesthetic” with the darker atmosphere and purple
        brick. I find comfort in listening to bossa nova.</p>

      <p class="joelleBio">JOELLE<br> My piece illustrates a young girl wandering toward a flooded temple,
        desolate but tranquil.
        The depth of the scene opens up with a trail of drifting lotus to the steps of the abandoned structure.
        Overgrown plants hang above the columns, giving off a rustic atmosphere. The girl peers into the columns and
        notices a water fountain spilling an eternal source of water. Perhaps she can leave a wish, unnoticed but
        meaningful. Utilizing Procreate and Mental Canvas, I designed a space that I find myself wishing to take a
        rest from the chaotic, packed society I live in.</p>

      <p class="liaBio">LIA<br> My world is a forest or a fairy forest that you can walk through and see inside the fairy house. I know it sounds simple but forest scenes help calm me down. It’s a place I know isn’t crowded with people and cities. The fairy part is to add imagination because I know you start to lose sight of that as you get older. I still feel it is important to get lost in a world of creativity and imagination no matter how old you are. .</p>
